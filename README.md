# Django docs from tests

This project will allow to generate some useful documentation about your API, just from the tests.
Your tests are basically the contract between the clients and the API, so nothing is more reliable then them.


# How to make it work

- first set up your project to use django-nose (might be optional in the future
- run the tests passing an extra option --docs-gen
